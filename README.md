# A Todo List Made with Modern React APIs

I decided to learn some of the new 'modern' React APIs by creating a fun and clean looking todo component.
It was fun playing with the react transitions npm package as well as adding the color picker for the todos
list upon my wife (Rachel's) request. I hope you enjoy this little React component.
